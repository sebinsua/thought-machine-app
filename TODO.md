* [ ] Unit test if modals are loaded correctly.
* [ ] Unit tests need to use https://github.com/katowulf/mockfirebase.
* [ ] E2E tests can be created if we find out how to reset firebase.
* [ ] Unswipe edit after the button is pressed.  (Need to fork and fix ionic framework code.)
* [ ] Back should go back to the correct scope. Mode needs to be set depending on some shared state.
